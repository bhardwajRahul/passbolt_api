Passbolt 5.5.2 resolves an issue introduced in the previous version that affected the editing of encrypted metadata settings. Due to zero-knowledge mode being required in some conditions, administrators were unable to edit the metadata key settings. This has now been fixed, restoring the ability to customize these settings.

We thank the community for reporting this issue!
